;; string-delete : String Number -> String
;; PURPOSE :
;; GIVEN : a string named as str.
;;         a number i as the position to
;;         be deleted from string str. i
;;         is between 0 and length of the
;;         given string str(exclusive).
;; RETURNS : a new string of length less
;;           than str and having ith
;;           position deleted from str.
;;
;; EXAMPLES :
;; (string-delete "game" 1) -> "gme"
;; (string-delete "hello" 4) -> "hell"
;; (string-delete "" 1) -> ""
;; (string-delete "a" 0) -> ""
;;
;; DESIGN STRATEGY : Divide into cases on length of string
