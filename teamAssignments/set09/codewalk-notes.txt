Helper Name:- Ameya

Design Grade:- A
Presentation Grade:- A
Correctness Score:- 15/15

Notes:-

1. target-x, target-y should return Integer instead of PosInt in PlaygroundState interface
2. Incorrect datatype PosInt for vel
3. Could avoid string literals for colors and shape type (use constants) [place-image ...]
4. Same for key-events and mouse-events
