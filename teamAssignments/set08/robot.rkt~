;; robot.rkt

;; Given an infinite chessborad.  The  chessboard extends  infinitely in  all
;; directions.  The   positions   on  the  board  are  pairs   of   integers.
;; On the chessboard, we have  a robot and  some blocks.  The  robot occupies
;; a single square on the chessboard, as does each of  the blocks.  The robot
;; can move any number of squares in any diagonal direction, but it can never
;; move to or through a square occupied by a block. In this way, its behavior
;; is like that of a bishop in chess.

;; The goal is to implement  functions to determine the  possible plan of the
;; the robot in order to reach a  given target position and  to determine the
;; final possible position of the robot on executing a given plan.
