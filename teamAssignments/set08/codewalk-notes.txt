TA Name:- Gabriel
Helper Name:- Prashanth

Design Grade:- B
Presentation Grade:- B 
Correctness Score:- 12/15

Notes:-
1. secs-to-lines doesn't document the invariant
2. render-wilder-1 purposte statement is very poor, doesn't document invariant, funciton should be decomposed
3. path function is really huge code

problem 2:
4. target-direction and move-towards-south-west target has same purpose statement.
5. move-next-in-south-west and & similar functions could be generalized they do more than one tasks.
6. purpose statement for threat? is missing
7. deadlock functions missing returns statement and could have been generalized
8. Many functions missing purpose statement and strategies.


soni28:
1. doesn't seem to have clarity about the code.
2. couldn't explain about the lines-to-width context arguments, relation between them and how they
